Dijkstra's algorithm in mine version
Just input n - nodes in your graph, s - starting node, f -finishing node.
Graph g (or something explaining edges) could been entered in this way (matrix) :
0 - distance to yourself
-1 - no connection
some value - node connected to another node and has some value price.
On input would be revealed minimal distance from s to f.
